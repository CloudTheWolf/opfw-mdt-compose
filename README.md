# Install 

0: In the DNS Settings for your domain, create 2 new A records for mdt and pd-server.

1: Install Docker, including the compose plugin (See here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 

2: Install Traefik (Replace mysite.com with your domain)
   Create a new directory called traefik and in that folder create a file called docker-compise.yml with the following: https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/traefik/docker-compose.yml  

3: Run the command `docker compose up -d`

4: Create 4 New Folders, one called mariadb and one called mdt-site, once called mdt-cache and once called mdt-bots

5: Create the file “/etc/mysql/conf.d/custom.cnf” with the contents from: https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/mariadb/etc/mysql/conf.d/custom.cnf 

6: In the mariadb folder created in Step 4, create a new file called docker-compose and put the following content: https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/mariadb/docker-compose.yml
   Make sure to update the `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD` value

7: From the mariadb folder created in Step 4, run the command: `docker compose up -d`

8: Next create 2 new folders, one with the path /conf/mdt-client/helpers and the other with the path /conf/mdt-v2-server

9: In the server folder create a new file called .env and paste the contents from https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/mdt/web/server/.env.example into this file

10: Set all the values as required, leaving OPFW_HTTP_API and HTTPS_KEY as is. (See here to get catbox hash: https://catbox.moe/user/register.php 

11: Now create a new file called pdRoles.js and paste the following contents: https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/mdt/web/server/bot/roles/pdRoles.js then configure with the roles you need. 

12: Now create a new file called emsRoles.js and paste the following contents: https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/mdt/web/server/bot/roles/emsRoles.js   then configure with the roles you need.

13: Now, client/helpers folder create a new file called axios-setup.js and paste the content of https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/mdt/web/client/axios-setup.js (replacing mysite.com with your site FQDN address, eg legacyrp.company) 

14: Going back to the mdt-site folder create a new file called docker-compose.yml and paste the contents of https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/mdt/web/docker-compose.yml then replace mysite.com with your FQDN on lines 20 and 45

15: Run the following commands:
 chmod 777 /conf/mdt-v2-server/.env 
And
chmod 777 /conf/mdt-client/helpers/axios-setup.js

16: Next, run the command docker login https://repo.legacyrp.company and enter the username and password (You will be given the username and password via Discord) 

17: Once done, make sure you are still in the mdt-site folder and run the command `docker compose up -d`

18: Next create the directory /var/www/html/op-framework and chmod it to 777

19: Download the latest version of the Cache Sync Tool https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/Legacy-API-Cache-Sync and put into /opt/bots/opfwsync/

20: Edit the appsettings.json and set the apiBaseUrl, apiKey, and mysql details

21: install the dotnet 6 and dotnet 8 runtimes (See instructions here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-debian )

```
23: Go to the mdt-cache folder created in step 4 and create a file called docker-compose.yml, then paste the contents of https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/opfw-mdt-compose/blob/main/http/docker-compose.yml 

24: Run the command `docker compose up -d`

26: Run the command `docker compose up -d`

27: If all is done correctly the bots should be Online and the MDT should be accessible.

28: Using the latest DB Schema (Provided in Via discord) import the schema using either MySql Workbench. Then go to the login table and create a new row with your CID, put the password as zzz and the reset_passphrase as changeme then set the date to some random future date.
